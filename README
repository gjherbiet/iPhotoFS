PhotoFS is a read-only filesystem for iPhoto collections on the Mac

It's useful for exploring your iPhoto library on other PCs or consumer
electronic devices.  It's also useful for backing up your iPhoto
library (even to non-macs while retaining its structure.)

You can easily interfact with your iPhoto collection using the Finder
and command line utilities like find and rsync.

INSTALLATION

Drag the iPhotoFS app to your Applications folder and launch it.
After a few moments the iPhotoFS volume will be mounted and a finder
window will open up with the volume selected.  You can then access the
Volume from either the command line or the finder.

EXAMPLE USAGE 

# list my flagged photos
$ ls /Volumes/iphotofs/Albums/Flagged/

# Export all of my albums to my PC
$ cp -R /Volumes/iphotofs/Albums /Volumes/MyPC/

# Show all photos taken in 2009-01
$ ls  /Volumes/iphotofs/Dates/2009-01
Installation

You must first install MacFUSE (http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/downloads/list)

Then simply run the iPhotoFS app and it will open up a new Finder window with the new filesystem selected.

DETAILS

The file system is a MacFuse user mode filesystem that reads iPhoto's AlbumData?.XML file.

Here's the current folder organization:

/Volumes/iphotofs/Albums contains subdirectories for all iPhoto albums.
/Volumes/iphotofs/Rolls contains all rolls.
/Volumes/iphotofs/Dates contains subdirectories for all Years/Months.

The original filenames are preserved when possible. In the event of name collision between two different files, the names are uniquified by prepending the roll ID.
